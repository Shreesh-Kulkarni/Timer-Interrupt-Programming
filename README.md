# Timer-Interrupt-Programming
A repository for all the program files and source codes to trigger interrupts and the use of timers in the PIC16F877A Microcontroller

Each Timer module folder contains an *isr.c* file which is the **Interrupt Service Routine** for the respective timer module in the microcontroller

*The Microchip XC8 compiler guide provides a set of instructions which can help to configure timers and trigger necessary interrupts in the device using C lang.*
