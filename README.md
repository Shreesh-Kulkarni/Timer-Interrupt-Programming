# Timer-Interrupt-Programming
A repository for all the program files and source codes to trigger interrupts and the use of timers in the PIC16F877A Microcontroller

*The Microchip XC8 compiler datasheet provides a set of instructions which can help to configure timers and trigger necessary interrupts in the device using C lang.*
